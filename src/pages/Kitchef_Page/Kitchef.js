                <p>Kitchef is a wearable technology, designed to create physical closeness and an emotional 
                    connection between children and their parents during a shared cooking experience. 
                    The technology enables an interactive and playful experience that strengthens the 
                    parent-child relationship and enhances the child‚Äôs sense of independence and security.
                    The Kitchef cooking kit includes two bracelets and a recipe box that accompanies
                    the parent and child in the cooking process.</p>

    <Projectcard projectDescription={kitchefMyRole}> 
        <p>As the IoT Developer and Research Assistant for the Kitchef project, 
            I led the technical development and overall coordination of this Tangible User Interface 
            (TUI) aimed at encouraging collaborative cooking between parents and children. 
            I programmed the system primarily using C++ in Arduino, developing key features 
            such as magnet-based wristbands and a smart recipe box that allowed users to 
            interact through a step-based cooking process. I was responsible for all wiring, 
            electrical components, and integrating Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication via ESP32 controllers 
            to ensure seamless functionality between hardware and software components.
        </p><br></br><p>
            In addition to my programming responsibilities, I acted as a product manager for the project, 
            overseeing all aspects of development and ensuring that each part of the system worked cohesively. 
            I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team, including a psychology and business student, two communication 
            students, and an additional programmer. With the guidance of external and internal mentors‚Äîincluding our lab
            professor, innovation lab mentors, and an industrial designer‚ÄîI translated insights from various disciplines 
            into effective technical solutions, making sure the project aligned with the needs and goals of all stakeholders.
        </p><br></br><p>
            My role extended to product design, where I contributed to the 3D design and fabrication of the Kitchef 
            box using CNC machining and 3D printing, and I also designed the Kitchef logo. I conducted user research, 
            observations, and validations during testing to refine the system. Additionally, I presented Kitchef at 
            several showcases, where I interacted with audiences and demonstrated the project‚Äôs functionality, 
            gathering valuable feedback. My broad involvement ensured that I had a deep understanding of how everything
            worked and how it should work, allowing me to guide the project to success.</p>
