      <p> My IoT creations encompasses various innovative projects where I designed and developed 
        interactive systems using sensors, capacitive touch, Wi-Fi and BLE connectivity, and microcontroller programming. 
        </p><br/><p>
        These projects include musical instrument, weather-responsive light show, and interactive games using 
        fruits like bananas and orange as capacitive inputs. Leveraging platforms 
        like ESP8266 and CPX, the projects integrate real-time API data, Neopixel lighting, sound generation, 
        and keyboard emulation to create immersive and responsive IoT experiences.

      <p> The Musical Spray is an IOT musical instrument with 4 metal touch buttons. 
        You can play this instrument by tauching each button with your fingers, Each 
        button generate different sound note. By trying to spray you can change between 4 modes who will 
        generate different notes. In the dark , the instrument starts to glow with red lights.
      </p> <br/>

         The circuit:
        <ul>
          <li>4 wires are connected to the pins A1,A2,A3,A4 respectevly</li>
          <li>the wires are connected to a coin which I wrapped with Aluminum foil,when touched,
            a circle is closed and the program outputs sound.</li>
          <li>Main button - 1 wire from A5 and 1 wire from Ground pin are connected to an external button. </li>
          <li>Light sensor - 3 neopixels light up corresponding to the light, when the area is dark 
            the neo pixels turn red.</li>

      <p> The Weather Box is a device that utilizes wifi connectivity to retrieve the current weather 
        conditions at a specified location, determined by the longitude and latitude entered. 
        The device then displays a customized light show corresponding to the current weather condition. 
        <ul> <br/>
          <li>Blue - for a rainy day </li>
          <li>Gray white - for cloudy days </li>
          <li>Yellow- for a sunny/clear day </li>
          <li>Pink - for a snowy day </li>
          <li> when is cloudy the box will preset white lights!</li>
        </ul>
        </p> <br/> <p>
      The program utilizes an ESP8266 modem to connect the CPX to wifi, and once connected, 
      it sends a request to the website https://openweathermap.org/ to obtain the requested API data based 
      on the specified longitude and latitude. The program then converts the weather data, in json format, 
      into a string by reading it letter by letter. It then extracts the main weather condition 
      from the string and subsequently displays a corresponding color light show based on the condition..
      </p> <br/>

         The circuit:
        <ul>
          <li>ESP8266 WiFi Module Interfacing with the cpx. </li>
          <li>One wire is connected to the pin A1 on one side, and to a conductive sticker on the other side. </li>
          <li>When the conductive sticker is touched, it completes a circuit and causes the light show to stop. </li>
          <li>The program also uses 10 neopixels to display the light show according to the weather conditions.</li>
